			"text": "As part of Dr. Fuller's Electronics II course, students were tasked with developing a SPICE simulation of a 6T SRAM cell. The contest challenged lab teams to achieve the fastest cycle consisting of writing a 0, reading a 0, writing a 1, and reading a 1. I completed this contest with Mark Batorski."
